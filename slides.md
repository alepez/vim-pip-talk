## WHY VIM?

 - It’s ubiquitous. You don’t have to worry about learning a new editor on various boxes.
 - It’s scalable. You can use it just to edit config files or it can become your entire writing platform.
 - It’s powerful. Because it works like a language vim takes you from frustrated to demigod very quickly.
